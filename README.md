# Chain.Love Infrastructure Database

This repository documents blockchain service providers - RPCs, wallets, explorers, analytics, bridges, dev tools, faucets, oracles, indexing services, etc. - in a structured way.

The goal is to build a **clean, comparable dataset** that developers and researchers can rely on.

## Repository Structure

```
├── networks/
│   ├── arbitrum/
│   │   ├── rpc.csv
│   │   ├── explorer.csv
│   │   ├── wallet.csv
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── ... (other networks, each with their own service tables)
```

Each **network folder** contains CSVs grouped by service type.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork & branch**: Fork the repo and create a descriptive branch (e.g. `add-ankr-provider`).
2. **Choose what to edit**: Pick the right CSV (e.g. `rpc.csv` in the correct network) and add/update your entry.
3. **Follow the rules**: Check the [Style Guide](https://github.com/Chain-Love/chain-love/wiki/Style-Guide) and [Column Definitions](https://github.com/Chain-Love/chain-love/wiki) for formatting and examples.

5. **Open a PR**: Describe your changes, link related issues. Maintainers will review and merge.
